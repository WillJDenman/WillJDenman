Welcome to my page! ^_^

Take a look around and see what suits your fancy. I'm primarily interested in data analysis, specifically linguistic analytics and security analysis.
I'll be posting various documentation and items that suit my interests (and hopefully yours!).

If there's any room for collaboration and wish to work with me, send me a message so we can get to work ASAP!

Thanks to all!

Cyber all the things.
